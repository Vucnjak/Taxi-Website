								<ul>
									<li> In the fall of 1946, less than a year after the close of World War II, Laclede Cab Company first began operating on the streets of St. Louis with 75 permits granted by the city of St. Louis.  <br>
									Headquarters for our startup operation was located at 923 North Seventh Street downtown – about one block north from the future site of the Edward Jones Dome. <br>
									Many of our senior customers may remember those days, riding in a distinctive Laclede Cab red and black Lasalle – or dialing “OL2-3456” to reach us from direct lines located throughout the city. </li> <br><br>
									
									<li>Laclede Cab quickly established itself as an industry leader and innovator with uniformed drivers, early package pickups and a computerized charge system. <br>
									Then in September 1947, just one year after beginning service, Laclede Cab purchased the first 2-way radio system in metropolitan St. Louis. </li> <br><br>
									
									<li>Less than a decade later, 1955 brought a period of growth and expansion for Laclede Cab with the purchase of 15 “Sparky’s” and 20 “RedTop” cabs. <br>
									And in 1975, Laclede Cab purchased the Black and White Cab Company, becoming the metro St. Louis’ largest cab company and servicing well over one million calls per year.</li> <br><br>
									
									<li>In 1996 Laclede Cab came under new ownership and began another period of growth – and reorganization. <br>
									While our distinctive red color was retained, gone were the black fenders of the past and the entire vehicles became bright, solid red with white lettering. <br>
									The entire fleet was upgraded and the average taxicab age decreased dramatically.  And rather than rates going up, Laclede Cab immediately took their rates down.</li> <br><br>
									
									<li>Currently, Laclede Cab’s business office is located at 600 South Vandeventer.  We’ve earned our business through top of the line equipment, prompt courteous service and fair pricing. <br>
									And our improvements didn’t stop in 1996.  In 2009 we upgraded the Call Center in our Dispatch Department, computerizing the process but keeping our live, friendly order takers. <br>
									And in 2010 we installed the newest, most sophisticated GPS Dispatching system in the St. Louis metropolitan area. <br>
									Pickups today are faster than ever before, our fleet is even larger, yet our pricing remains low and remains fair.</li> <br><br>
									
									<li>We’d like to thank you for stopping by to check us out. 
									Put us in your cell phone and give us a call next time you need cab service.  
									At Laclede Cab, we know we need you – and we’re anxious to earn your business!</li>
